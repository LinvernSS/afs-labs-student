For your stir fry drop the pea shoots in to retain some crunch. All young greens concentrate the nutrition of the mature vegetable.Packed with vitamins A, C and folic acid, Pea Shoots are a delicious, nutritious modern slant on the classic British garden pea. Lyndel Costain, B.Sc.RD, award winning dietitian and author of Super Nutrients Handbook, says, “Pea Shoots are a nutritious leaf with high levels of vitamin C and vitamin A. A 50g bag of these tasty greens offers more than half of the RDA for vitamin C, a quarter of the RDA for vitamin A and significant amounts of folic acid.

361	Harbison	Harbison is named for Anne Harbison, affectionately known as the grandmother of Greensboro. Along with breathtaking views, traditions and people are part of what makes Vermont's working landscape special; we're proud to honor Ms. Harbison's contribution with this cheese.Harbison is a soft-ripened cheese with a rustic, bloomy rind. Young cheeses are wrapped in strips of spruce cambium, the tree's inner bark layer, harvested from the woodlands of Jasper Hill. The spoonable texture begins to develop in our vaults, though the paste continues to soften on the way to market. Harbison is woodsy and sweet, balanced with lemon, mustard, and vegetal flavors.Harbison is a great excuse to gather a few friends and scoop into a decadent treat. When a bit younger, the bark can be peeled away for sliced portioning. If the bark has fused with a more loosened paste, then the best approach is to leave the bark intact and spoon out portions from the top. Pair with oaked white wine, or barrel-aged sour beer. Fruit mostarda and crusty bread make nice accompaniments.Ingredients: Pasteurized cows milk, rennet, cultures, salt, 	10	oz	16.49	26.38	lb	Dairy	T-Day Essentials	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/PLGcM8X0RqyYfcMy13eQ_20160921-JasperHill_Harbison_MG_1519.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

674	Comté	Comté is a French cheese produced in the Jura Massif region of Eastern France. The unpasteurised cow's milk used is mainly from Montbeliarde Cattle or French simmental (or cross breeds of the two).

There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. Comté was one of the first few cheeses to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tones of annual production.Considered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.There are practically 83 flavours, which can be savored while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.Its ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.	5.34	oz	9.99	29.93	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/uYJB6dAhRWaUQgpWjPiF_FK1A0070.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

676	Carmody	Our Carmody was also inspired by a trip to Italy. We had an opportunity to watch\nGorgonzola being made near Milan. Many Gorgonzola makers are secretive and limit\naccess to their cheese making but our contact was able to get us inside for a short\ntour. After watching the cheese make we went into a ripening room they had at the\nfacility to see some of the early stages of Gorgonzola aging. In one of the rooms there\nwere some small wheels of cheese on an out of the way shelf. We were able to try\na wheel and found it to be a very mild but creamy cheese that still had a great deal\nof fresh milk flavor. We never saw the cheese made but began to notice similar table\ncheeses wherever we bought cheese. They were marketed under a variety of names\nbut meant for local consumption. It occurred to us that a cheese of this type might\nappeal to our customers in the US as an alternative to the young Cheddars or Jack\ncheeses that dominated the market. Once we returned from the trip I began working\non the cheese by using our pecorino recipe as a starting point and making changes\nin response to the flavors and texture of the cheese. Eventually we found a combination\nwe liked. Carmody is meant to highlight the buttery flavors or Jersey milk. At that\npoint we gave it a name with local meaning—Carmody is the road that runs adjacent\nto the farm.\nIngredients:\nPasteurized Jersey Cows Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures and Salt\nTexture: Semi-Firm\nAged: Minimum of 6 weeks\nRind: Natural	7	oz	8.59	19.63	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/6lGfmlFfTVG4vzKXCyAP_FK1A2882.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N
677	Ossau Iraty	Ossau-Iraty is probably the least known 'Appelation d'Origine Controlee' (A.O.C) cheese. The Ossau-Iraty unites two regions of France in the Western Pyrénées: Ossau in the valley of the Bearn, and Iraty in the beech forests of the Pays Basque. The Ossau-Iraty is full of a delicious, nutty, robust taste if it is produced during the period from June to September when the herds move up to the high mountain meadows. Covered by a thick orange to grey rind, the pâte is white, supple and ceamy. It becomes more firm as the maturing period is longer. An artisan pate may have small holes and should not stick to the palate.Made by the Onetik dairy cooperative with the raw milk of Manech and Basco-Bearnaise sheep and aged for 90 days, Ossau Iraty is unctuous, nutty, sweet, and slightly gamey. And if you’re so inclined, it melts like a dream.	5.34	oz	8.99	26.94	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/c6ZCHvLKRc1JiVb7hEuQ_FK1A0029.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	\N	\N	\N	\N

If left to grow further, the garlic greens would die off in the heat of the summer, after the bulbs has rounded out, and, when hung up to dry, the familiar papery cellulose layers around and between the cloves would form a protective layer that enables the garlic heads to stay in storage for up to a year. At this stage in the plant's life, the whole plant is edible and can be chopped up much like a scallion. It has a sweeter, milder flavor than when the bulbs are fully cured.Try using green garlic in a stir-fry or chopped up with eggs.  For a quick (and delicious) kitchen project, use green garlic instead of basil in your next batch of pesto.	0.5	lb	4.99	9.98	lb	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/vHO29vDVSwS8Fkm7FGA4_FK1A1742.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	389	\N	\N	\N

20	Hachiya Persimmon Trio	Hachiyas are often the reason people think they hate Persimmons. Eaten before it's fully ripe, it's got an awful, astringent quality that'll dry your mouth out and make you swear off these otherwise delicious fruits forever. But, when the Hachiya reaches a stage of extreme softness--an almost jelly-like state where the skin and flesh taken on an translucent quality and it must be handled very gently to not break the delicate skin--its tannins give way to sugars, and the Hachiya becomes one of the sweetest fruits around. Eat (messily) out of hand, or if you're trying to impress your guests, you can place the persimmon stem-side down, slice off the tip, and serve with a spoon.	3	count	5.99	4.28	lb	Produce	New & Peak Season	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/zr7UoOaQSBm7brcGynnc_persimmon_01.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	356	\N	\N	\N

125	Organic Spring Red Torpedo Onions	Rick and Kristie Knoll grow some of the most beautiful alliums in the Bay Area on their 18-acre, diversified fruit and vegetable farm in Brentwood, CA.  Spring Onions are the spring (or sometimes fall) versions of the cured bulbs you're used to seeing year-round at the grocery store. If left to grow further, the onion greens would die off in the heat of the summer, and then after the bulbs had thickened up a bit, they'd be hung up to dry, and the familiar papery cellulose layers would form a protective layer that enables the onion to stay in storage for a few months up to a year, depending upon the variety. At this stage in the plant's life, the whole plant is edible and can be chopped up much like a scallion. It has a sweeter, milder flavor than when the bulbs are fully cured.	1	bunch	3.49	13.96	lb	Produce	Vegetables	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/YaAyiZTxed18onFlcR4w_20161029-RedOnion_MG_5733.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	253	\N	\N	\N

In New Orleans, they're frequently battered and deep fried.

After two minutes, add the leaves, coarsely chopped.  Shake the pan around to make sure the shallots don't burn, then remove from heat after 3-4 minutes, before the greens are full cooked.  They'll continue to wilt and become more tender after.  Season to taste, and add some red pepper flakes for an extra kick or some raisins or dried cranberries to bring out the Spigariello's natural sweetness.	1	bunch	2.49	6.23	lb	Produce	Greens	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/J5MxlTmYQt6XJDc19ZoI_GoodEggs027644.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	252	\N	\N	\N

Fresh horseradish can also be finely shaved and used to top a plate of steak, potatoes or anything else that could benefit from a slight kick.Fresh horseradish should be scrubbed thoroughly before being grated or thrown into a blender, but as a whole root, it can last for many weeks (if not months) in the fridge in a plastic bag.	0.5	lb	3.99	7.98	lb	Produce	Herbs	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/4hAt5CwUTUeTvmZ69kd6_FK1A1656.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	336	\N	\N	\N

The sides of the barns are screened and can be opened to allow in natural sunlight and the fresh sea breeze.A true family business, Glaum has been far ahead of the game for generations (four, to be precise) when it comes to cage-free eggs and sustainable ranching.

607	Gruyere	While Switzerland is the country most people associate with Gruyere's origin, its history actually encompasses several European countries. About a thousand years ago, the Holy Roman Empire extended its wily grip around all of what we now know as France, Switzerland, and some of Germany, and the forests of this area were called "gruyeres." Charlemagne's men sold wood to the cheesemakers of the area to power their curd cooking kettles, and the cheesemakers paid for the wood with their cheeses. These are the cheeses that we now know, eat and love as Comte and Gruyere. Gruyere is smooth in texture and has rich, beefy flavors that are tempered by hints of apples and pears.

619	Organic Truly Raw Milk Cheddar Cheese	Our raw cheddar cheese is North America's first truly raw pasture fed cheddar cheese. Unlike most other raw cheeses, Truly Raw is never heated above 105 degrees (Fahrenheit) during the cheese making procedure.Why Say “Truly Raw”?Many so called raw cheeses are actually heated to temperatures "just under" legal pasteurized temperatures of 161 degrees, denaturing enzymes and killing beneficial bacteria. It is done primarily to offset the poor quality of milk used to make raw cheese in the conventional market and to increase the activity of the cultures that are added. The cheddar cheese is aged a minimum of 60 days.USDA organic standards require that cows be pasture grazed just four months out of the year. OPDC goes far beyond this standard and grazes our cows on green pastures every day. In addition to green pastures, our cows are fed: a specially formulated organic mineral supplement, free choice salt and trace mineral blocks, high test organic alfalfa, and some sweet organic corn to keep them healthy and strong. Ingredients: Organic Whole Raw Milk, Vegetable Rennet, Cultures, Salt	8	oz	8.49	16.98	lb	Dairy	Cheese	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/puIfo2YjTluse2qpYf03_FK1A5474.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	316	\N	\N	\N

1022	McFarland Springs Trout, Two Fillets	Missing CA Salmon season? Two X Sea offers an incredible alternative to Atlantic farmed salmon- 100% vegetarian fed, CA raised, McFarland Springs trout! A product that truly has to be tasted to be believed, this is a Good Eggs staff favorite.McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is filleted with the skin on for easy cooking on the grill or on the stove. Arrives fresh, not frozen. For recipe ideas check out our website.About our trout:TwoXSea began testing our fishmeal alternative in 2009 to produce a farmed trout using a nearly pure vegetarian diet of algae, and plant-based products. Originally the feed contained approximately 3% fish oil, which has since been completely eliminated to create a farmed trout that is raised on a 100% vegetarian diet. The results we achieved are stunning and a true culinary delight. The beautifully balanced sweet flavor, superior texture and lighter firm flesh almost perfectly mirror that of a wild trout. The Omega 3 levels are higher than that of wild salmon as well.McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	1	lb	18.99	18.99	lb	Fish	What We Love	http://goodeggs1.imgix.net/product_photos/LXZeml1QTIOPS1FvtBZY_mcfarland%20springs%20trout%20fillet%2010-10-12.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	286	\N	\N	\N

1040	Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillet	Sometimes the freshest seafood comes from\nthe freezer. \nAs soon as fish leaves the water it\nbegins losing freshness. Your average fillet is several days old by the time it\nreaches your plate, and the taste and texture have already suffered. We use\nfreezing to stop time and preserve the freshness of our fish. We seal our fish\nin vacuum bags that protect the fillets from freezer burn. We freeze our\nindividually vacuum packaged fillets quickly and at a low temperature, which\npreserves the texture of the fish. Most importantly, we freeze our fish immediately\nafter it’s caught. Our fish doesn’t travel the world, it’s landed twenty miles\nfrom where it’s filleted and frozen. Thaw exactly the amount you need right\nbefore you need it, and our fish will always taste like it was reeled in\nyesterday. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur\nsablefish are caught off the coast of Northern California by small-scale fishing\nboats using traps. We rush to make sure that the fish are filleted and frozen immediately,\nso that our sablefish tastes like it was caught yesterday. These rich, buttery\nfish are commonly called Black cod, though they are not technically a part of the\ncod family. You can hold these fillets in your freezer for up to one year.\nThawing Instructions: It is\nbest to thaw our Frozen Wild Sablefish Fillets slowly under refrigeration. Thawing\nslowly keeps the fillets firm. Nobody likes mushy fish. Thaw just what you\nplan on eating. Remove fillets from bags and place in a bowl inside your\nrefrigerator.

1056	Smoked McFarland Springs Trout Fillet	McFarland Springs Trout is delicious and nutritious. And it's more than unique – it is the world’s first deliberate collaboration to responsibly farm sustainable fish. This product is smoked fillets prepackaged with the skin on. Great for use as lox for bagels and cream cheese, on a salad, or just by itself. About our trout:McFarland Springs is an environmental dream. The water supply comes from the headwaters of a natural spring, extremely cold and free of the pesticides and contaminates found in other water sources. The spring not only provides for the trout, but also generates all of the electricity for the farm though hydroelectric. It is raised locally, lowering carbon footprint and further promoting regional cuisine. The fish is hand harvested and processed, instead of machine processed as is customary.Typically, farmed fish are fed fishmeal which is made up of small fish that are being taken from the ocean at alarming rates. These fish are then ground, dried, and fed to many types of farmed fish in order to increase their growth rates. This practice is an environmental catastrophe and not sustainable. With higher levels of healthy Omega-3s than wild salmon, and zero trace of mercury or contaminants, McFarland Springs trout provides exceptional nutrition benefits. Lastly, the flavor and texture is that of wild trout with a sweet flavor and lighter, firm flesh. The extreme cold created by the natural spring creates slow growth rates, but far better texture.Thanks for your support!-Team TwoXSea 	1.25	lb	44.99	2.25	oz	Fish	Smoked	http://goodeggs2.imgix.net/product_photos/vOfMSmTTSuiqBP1VjOYP_FK1A8418.jpg?w=380&h=238&fm=jpg&q=41&fit=crop	286	\N	\N	\N
